## Proto ãƒ„ â–º My powerful & polyvalent Discord bot.
Proto is a **Discord bot** coded in [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and based on [Discord.js v12](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v12/general/welcome).
This project is *currently stopped* at the `beta v0.0.4` because of my studies
- The goal â–º Objectives Of Proto ãƒ„
  - *Main* goal : The reason Proto ãƒ„ was created for is being THE bot in your servers rather than a hundred which each have only one function
  - *Side* goal : This bot was also made to improve my organisation and my coding skills in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
